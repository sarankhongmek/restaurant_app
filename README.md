#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview:

We were giving an Restaurant Reviews web application project and to complete this project it must meet the requirements that was given.

## Requirement

  1) Make the website responsive 

  2) Add accessibility to the website

  3) Add service worker to the website to make it offline first compatible



### Specification

we been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. my job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Installing and get running on local

1. Install python go to this link (https://www.python.org/) and download.

In a terminal check what version of python you are running: `python -V`

For python 2.x: in a terminal run this command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
 
For Python 3: python -m http.server 8000

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`






## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
